## Description

JART Suite - Just Another Red Team Suite
* See also: Jarts - What could possibly go wrong?

Mangliis (Mangle IIS)
* Provide APT like threats for CCDC so they gain real world experience.

## Quick Features:
* windows\mangliis
* Kernel driver that hides the driver file and corrupts IIS servers
* Built for Server 2012
* Hides it's own driver "filecrypt.sys" by redirecting file opens to "filetrace.sys"
* The service is visible and can be stopped normally (net stop filecrypt)
* The service does not run in safe mode, so the driver is not hidden in safe mode
* Note: There is a Windows 10 service for filecrypt.sys

## Quick Install:

Install: install.exe 201803011200
Uninstall: install.exe cdcc

## Quick Check:

## More Information:
filecrypt.sys is a Windows Kernel File System Filter that can hide files by redirecting any open of a specific file to another file. The driver itself redirects opens from filecrypt.sys (this is a valid Windows 10 driver name) to filetrace.sys.

I confirmed that when you run Sysinternals->Autoruns that the filecrypt service is marked as a "Microsoft service", with everything legit. Any virus scanning tool that is not run in safe mode will have issues with this driver, if my driver loads first.  filecrypt has no safe mode protections.

I consider filecrypt a "level 5 of 10" challenge (10 being the hardest); because standard tools will not find this tool.


Anyone involved in any CCDC event has my permision to use this driver for any CCDC event. If you would like to use this driver for another event; please contact me first.
